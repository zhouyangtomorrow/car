This is a small regression project that I created for an interview I had.  
I was given a small csv file of data to make sense of and possibly make a regression model (no further detail was given).
Small data set has missing values, boolean data, categorical data, etc--all things need to be dealt.
I used the charming Pycare regression package to build a couple of models for comparison and chose the best performing one for deployment. 
The unique part of this small project is that I also built a simple flask Web API and deployed it in Heroku by repurpose some old code elsewhere.
It is an end to end, deployed simple machine learning model that offers a cool framework can be used to deploy your own projects. 
Grab it, reuse it, and have fun. =)
